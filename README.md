# Schmemory starter kit

This starter kit includes babel, sass, webpack and webpack-dev-server to hopefully help with
reducing the time spent on boilerplate stuff. Please start by running

```bash
npm install
```

This will get these packages installed. When that's done, you can — at any time — do `npm start` to
run a development server.

If you are interested in using a simple server to produce images for your cards, you can look in the
sub-folder [example-image-server](./example-image-server).
